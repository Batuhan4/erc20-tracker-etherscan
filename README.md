# erc20-tracker-etherscan
track erc20 bought sold and values

basicly its a test of using etherscan api to look DMG token trades ( bought and sold and value)
so we can track bigger bought means bigger trust for DMG :d
the thing that i learned from this project : DONT USE ETHERSCAN API If you could use uniswap api :D

sorry for dirty code


how to use: drag html to browser after writing api key to js file then open console
